    summary: "Pablo Picasso (1881–1973) was a Spanish painter and sculptor who co-founded Cubism and reshaped modern art. Over seven decades, he moved restlessly between styles, mediums, and ideas. His output—paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture, ceramics—reflects relentless experimentation. Picasso’s influence extends beyond galleries into how we see form, perspective, and emotion in visual culture.",
    section1_heading: "Early life",
    section1_content: "Picasso was born in Málaga in 1881 to a family steeped in art, with his father serving as an art teacher. He displayed prodigious skill from childhood, copying classical works and studying anatomy and proportion. A move to Barcelona exposed him to avant‑garde circles that nurtured his rebellious energy. Early periods like the Blue and Rose phases already show his fascination with mood and human vulnerability. Even then, he was probing how style could channel psychology rather than mere realism.",
    section2_heading: "Major works",
    section2_content: "Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (1907) shattered conventions of perspective and introduced a fractured, mask‑like reality. Guernica (1937), a monumental anti‑war canvas, turned pain and chaos into stark geometry and light. Later works range from neoclassical figures to playful, graphic ceramics. Across media, the common thread is a willingness to dismantle familiar forms and rebuild them to intensify meaning. Each masterpiece feels less like a fixed answer than a charged, ongoing question.",
    section3_heading: "Cubism",
    section3_content: "Together with Georges Braque, Picasso pioneered Analytic and Synthetic Cubism, dissolving objects into multiple viewpoints. The goal was not confusion but a richer truth: seeing reality as composite and layered. Collage—newspapers, wallpaper, found materials—entered the studio, fusing everyday texture with fine art. Cubism influenced architecture, design, and literature by legitimizing fragmentation as a modern grammar. It taught viewers to read images like ideas, not just pictures.",
    section4_heading: "Style and methods",
    section4_content: "Picasso resisted being trapped by any single approach, moving freely between realism, abstraction, and surreal inflection. He used line like a conductor, guiding rhythm across forms, and color as emotional temperature. Sculpture and ceramics let him twist space physically, not only pictorially. Printmaking became a laboratory for variation and serial thinking. The result is a career that treats style as a living instrument rather than a label.",
    section5_heading: "Legacy and outlook",
    section5_content: "Picasso’s legacy is the permission he grants to break rules with purpose. Museums preserve his works, yet his true impact lives in artists’ courage to experiment. In a digital era, his curiosity reads like a blueprint for playful, iterative creation. As technology multiplies tools, Picasso’s lesson is to keep meaning at the center. The future will continue to translate his daring into new materials, platforms, and audiences."

Each verse becomes a mirror that reveals the reader as much as the poet.",
